**THIS REPO IS FORKED**

Do you want your bundles generated by Parcel to have a **shebang** and it was easy to start from the console? This plugin allows this. You can build CLI applications in a simple way!

## Installing

To install the plugin simply download the module.<br>
You can use npm for this.

```shell
npm i -D parcel-plugin-shebang
```

## Getting Started

After successful installation, the plugin should work.<br>
If you use this plugin without [configuration](#configuration) (which is described below) it will generate for you shebang automagically. However, the plugin only **works when** it finds a shebang line in source files that are `entry points` of Parcel.

> Without this plugin, if you place a shebang line in the source file, Parcel will leave it in code and treat it the same as normal JavaScript code. Unfortunately, after running this file you will get `SyntaxError`. This plugin is designed to move the shebang line to the very top of the file so that it does not cause any syntax problems.

Here you can find a problem that tries to solve this plugin:<br>

## Configuration

The plugin has an **optional configuration** that allows you to generate shebang in bundle files. This is useful if you want your source files to not have a shebang.

There are two ways to configure the plugin:
- You can use a dedicated configuration `.shebangrc` file.
- Alternatively, you can save the configuration in the `package.json` file.

The configuration of the plugin is an array of objects describing the name of the interpreter and the array of files for which this interpreter is to be used.

> An array can contain many objects.<br>If the path to the file repeats in the next object, the interpreter from the first passed object containing the given file will be used.

| Name          | Type     | Description                                                                  |
| ------------- |----------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `interpreter` | string   | Name of interpreter.                                 |
| `files`       | string[] | Array of relative paths to the files in which the interpreter is to be used. |

<br>

.shebangrc
```json
[
  {
    "interpreter": "node",
    "files": [
      "./cli.ts"
    ]
  }
]
```

package.json
```json
...

"shebang": [
  {
    "interpreter": "node",
    "files": [
      "./cli.ts"
    ]
  }
]

...
```

**Now if you run the command:**

```shell
parcel build ./cli.ts
```

The resulting file should contain a shebang with a `node` interpreter.
